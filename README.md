## ✨ What's New in v2.6.2

- 📬 **Gravity Forms Suite (18 tools)** — full read/write control over Gravity Forms, with **List Forms** and **Get Form** ON by default and all write tools OFF. Toggled from **MCP > Settings** under the "Gravity Forms" group (icon: 📋). Covers **forms** (list, get, create, update, delete, update settings), **entries** (list, get, update, delete with trash/permanent support), **notifications** (get, create, update, delete), and **confirmations** (get, create, update, delete — message/redirect/page types). All callbacks use `GFAPI` and enforce strict Gravity Forms capability checks (`gravityforms_edit_forms`, `gravityforms_create_form`, `gravityforms_delete_forms`, `gravityforms_view_entries`, `gravityforms_edit_entries`, `gravityforms_delete_entries`). Only registered when Gravity Forms is active.

## ✨ What's New in v2.6.1

- 📬 **Gravity Forms Suite** — introduced the 18-tool Gravity Forms integration, with List Forms and Get Form ON by default and all write tools OFF. Toggled from **MCP > Settings** under the "Gravity Forms" group. Covers **forms**, **entries**, **notifications**, and **confirmations**. All callbacks use `GFAPI` and enforce strict Gravity Forms capability checks (`gravityforms_edit_forms`, `gravityforms_create_form`, `gravityforms_delete_forms`, `gravityforms_view_entries`, `gravityforms_edit_entries`, `gravityforms_delete_entries`). Only registered when Gravity Forms is active.

## ✨ What's New in v2.6.0

- 🧱 **Ultimate Addons for Elementor (UAE) Suite** — 45 new tools for UAE, all off by default and toggled from **MCP > Settings** under the "Ultimate Addons Elementor" group. Covers **widgets** (activate, deactivate, bulk toggle, check usage, list), **templates** (create, duplicate, trash, restore, and update Header/Footer/Blocks templates), the **builder/engine** (add sections, add columns, move elements, build layouts from JSON), and **settings** (get/update UAE plugin settings, theme info, extensions, and design-system tokens). String inputs are sanitized with `wp_kses_post()` and every tool enforces a strict capability check (`edit_posts`, `publish_posts`, or `manage_options`). Only registered when UAE is active.
- 🐛 **Fixed `wsp_uae_builder_add_column`** — it silently created a `container` instead of a `column` because the type validation in `wsp_execute_elementor_add_container()` only accepted `container` and `section`. `column` is now a valid type.

## ✨ What's New in v2.5.0

- 🖼️ **Full Media Library Suite** — the single read-only media tool is now a complete set of seven: **List Media** (browse/search by type, keyword, or date), **Get Media** (full metadata of a single attachment by ID), **Count Media** (counts grouped by MIME type + total), **Update Media** (title, alt text, caption, description), **Delete Media** (permanent), and **Upload Media** / **Upload Media From URL** (import a file straight from any web link). All off by default and toggled from **MCP > Settings**. Reads require `upload_files`, deletes require `delete_posts`; uploads sanitize the source URL and sideload via WordPress core.
- ⚠️ **`wsp_get_media` behavior changed** — it now returns the full metadata of a **single** attachment by ID. The old "list the library" behavior moved to the new **`wsp_list_media`** tool. If you relied on `wsp_get_media` to list media, switch to `wsp_list_media`.

## ✨ What's New in v2.4.1

- 🔒 **Hardened ACF writes** — all ACF field-value write tools now recursively sanitize incoming values before saving (each string is run through `wp_kses_post()`), so `<script>`/`<style>` and inline event handlers can no longer be stored through the MCP tools. Legitimate WYSIWYG/HTML content still works. Resolves the WordPress.org "arbitrary code insertion" review finding.

## ✨ What's New in v2.4.0

- 🔌 **OpenCode connection tab** — a sixth copy-paste config snippet on **MCP > Connection**, joining Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, and OpenClaw. OpenCode connects natively over remote HTTP (no Node.js bridge); the snippet is a full `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` file ready to create and paste.

## ✨ What's New in v2.3.0

- 🧩 **Advanced Custom Fields Suite** — 27 new tools for ACF: field groups, fields, field values with **dot-notation deep access** (e.g. `repeater.0.subfield`), custom post types, taxonomies, and options pages. All off by default and only registered when ACF is active; structural changes (create/update/delete groups, fields, CPTs, taxonomies) require `manage_options`, with per-object capability checks on every value read/write.
- 🏷️ **Plugin slug renamed** to `wsp-mcp-ai-agents-connector` to match the public name ahead of WordPress.org submission. ⚠️ **Breaking on existing installs** — WordPress treats the renamed folder as a separate plugin, so remove the old `websensepro-mcp-abilities` copy and activate the new one. Saved settings, the sessions table, and the API key are preserved (no reconfiguration needed).

## ✨ What's New in v2.2.0

- 🧹 **Native-Only** — the legacy dual-mode Abilities-API / MCP-Adapter registration path and the **MCP > Config Files** page have been removed. The built-in native server is now the single transport.
- 🔁 **Seamless Redirects** — old bookmarks to the Config Files page now redirect to **MCP > Connection**.
- ⚠️ **Breaking** — connections made before v2.0 through the WordPress MCP Adapter must be re-created using the native endpoint on **MCP > Connection**. New installs and native connections are unaffected.

## Previous Releases

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** WordPress 6.2+, PHP 7.4+ — **that's it.** No companion plugin, no MCP Adapter, no Node.js for natively-supported clients (Cursor, Codex, Antigravity). Claude Desktop & OpenClaw use the `mcp-remote` bridge, which needs Node.js 18+.

1. Install & activate this plugin
2. Go to **MCP > Settings** in wp-admin and enable the abilities you need
3. Go to **MCP > Connection** and pick your client tab (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, or OpenClaw)
4. Copy the snippet — the endpoint URL and API key are already filled in — and paste it into your client's config
5. Reconnect / restart the client and start prompting your AI agent

> **Upgrading from before v2.0?** As of v2.2 the legacy MCP-Adapter / Abilities-API path and the **MCP > Config Files** page have been removed. Re-create your connection using the native endpoint on **MCP > Connection**.
