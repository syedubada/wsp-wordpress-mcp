## ✨ What's New in v2.4.1

- 🔒 **Hardened ACF writes** — all ACF field-value write tools now recursively sanitize incoming values before saving (each string is run through `wp_kses_post()`), so `<script>`/`<style>` and inline event handlers can no longer be stored through the MCP tools. Legitimate WYSIWYG/HTML content still works. Resolves the WordPress.org "arbitrary code insertion" review finding.

## ✨ What's New in v2.4.0

- 🔌 **OpenCode connection tab** — a sixth copy-paste config snippet on **MCP > Connection**, joining Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, and OpenClaw. OpenCode connects natively over remote HTTP (no Node.js bridge); the snippet is a full `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` file ready to create and paste.

## ✨ What's New in v2.3.0

- 🧩 **Advanced Custom Fields Suite** — 27 new tools for ACF: field groups, fields, field values with **dot-notation deep access** (e.g. `repeater.0.subfield`), custom post types, taxonomies, and options pages. All off by default and only registered when ACF is active; structural changes (create/update/delete groups, fields, CPTs, taxonomies) require `manage_options`, with per-object capability checks on every value read/write.
- 🏷️ **Plugin slug renamed** to `wsp-mcp-ai-agents-connector` to match the public name ahead of WordPress.org submission. ⚠️ **Breaking on existing installs** — WordPress treats the renamed folder as a separate plugin, so remove the old `websensepro-mcp-abilities` copy and activate the new one. Saved settings, the sessions table, and the API key are preserved (no reconfiguration needed).

## ✨ What's New in v2.2.0

- 🧹 **Native-Only** — the legacy dual-mode Abilities-API / MCP-Adapter registration path and the **MCP > Config Files** page have been removed. The built-in native server is now the single transport.
- 🔁 **Seamless Redirects** — old bookmarks to the Config Files page now redirect to **MCP > Connection**.
- ⚠️ **Breaking** — connections made before v2.0 through the WordPress MCP Adapter must be re-created using the native endpoint on **MCP > Connection**. New installs and native connections are unaffected.

## Previous Releases

**v2.1.0** — 🛒 **WooCommerce Suite** — 15 new tools covering products (list, get, create, create variation, update), orders (list, update status, refund), coupons (create, list), order notes, customers, sales reports, low-stock alerts, and review moderation. All off by default and only registered when WooCommerce is active; financial/PII tools require the `manage_woocommerce` capability.

**v2.0.0**
- 🚀 **Built-in Native MCP Server** — the plugin ships its own MCP server at `/wp-json/wsp-mcp/v1/mcp`. **No companion plugin, WordPress MCP Adapter, or Node.js bridge required.**
- 🔌 **MCP > Connection Page** — endpoint URL, API key (with one-click regenerate), and ready-to-paste config tabs for **Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, and OpenClaw** — the API key is pre-filled for you.
- 🔐 **Flexible Auth** — connect with a WordPress Application Password **or** the plugin's API key (`Authorization: Bearer`), with per-tool capability enforcement.
- 🗂️ **Cleaner Settings** — ability groups are now collapsible accordions with live enabled/total counts.


**v1.3.0** — 🔍 Yoast SEO abilities (read/update SEO title, meta description, focus keyphrase); group only appears when Yoast is active.

- 🔒 **Granular Ability Controls** — enable/disable each ability individually; Elementor group only shown when Elementor is active

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** WordPress 6.2+, PHP 7.4+ — **that's it.** No companion plugin, no MCP Adapter, no Node.js for natively-supported clients (Cursor, Codex, Antigravity). Claude Desktop & OpenClaw use the `mcp-remote` bridge, which needs Node.js 18+.

1. Install & activate this plugin
2. Go to **MCP > Settings** in wp-admin and enable the abilities you need
3. Go to **MCP > Connection** and pick your client tab (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, or OpenClaw)
4. Copy the snippet — the endpoint URL and API key are already filled in — and paste it into your client's config
5. Reconnect / restart the client and start prompting your AI agent

> **Upgrading from before v2.0?** As of v2.2 the legacy MCP-Adapter / Abilities-API path and the **MCP > Config Files** page have been removed. Re-create your connection using the native endpoint on **MCP > Connection**.
