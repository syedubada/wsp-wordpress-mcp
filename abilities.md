# Abilities (Tool Registry)

This file is the **source of truth** for the abilities shown on the
[Abilities Directory](https://freewordpressmcp.com/abilities-directory) page (`abilities-directory.html`).

Each ability is one MCP tool the **WSP MCP – AI Agents Connector** plugin exposes to a connected AI agent.
The list mirrors the plugin registry at
`wsp-mcp-ai-agents-connector/includes/registry.php` in
[bilalnaseer/wsp-wordpress-mcp](https://github.com/bilalnaseer/wsp-wordpress-mcp).

**When this file changes, update the `ABILITIES` array in `abilities-directory.html` to match** (and bump the `lastmod` date for that page in `sitemap.xml`).
